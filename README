NAME
    Pod::Weaver::Section::Collect::FromOther - Import sections from other
    POD

VERSION
    This document describes 0.002 of
    Pod::Weaver::Section::Collect::FromOther - released February 28, 2012 as
    part of Pod-Weaver-Section-Collect-FromOther.

DESCRIPTION
    Copy chunks of POD from other documents, and incorporate them. Our
    purpose here is to enable the easy documentation of packages that serve
    to combine parts of preexisting packages (and thus preexisting
    documentation).

METHODS
  prepare_input($input)
    Check the given $input for any commands that would trigger us, and
    extract/insert pod as requested.

  copy_sections_from_other($module, $header_text, $opts)
    Loads the POD from $module (specified as a package name, in our @INC),
    looks for a "=head1" section with $header_text, and copies everything
    pulls it out until the next "=head1" section.

    We return the elements we find from the first command until the next
    section; this is to enable preface text to be skipped. This behaviour
    can be altered by setting $opts to 'all';

    We return a series of elements suitable for inclusion directly into
    another document. Note that if this set includes a list, that list will
    be converted, with each "=item" command becoming a "=head2".
